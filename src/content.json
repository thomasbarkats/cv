      "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Thomas BARKATS, a passionate about software & engineering development with a strong foundation as a full-stack lead developer. I thrive on technical challenges and am constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow. I have extensive experience in the world of JavaScript / TypeScript / Node.js, but am always open to exploring other languages, as I believe the key is understanding the logic, algorithms, and fundamentals behind the code.",
      "ðŸ“ˆ In recent years, I have transitioned towards project management, where I've enjoyed combining my technical knowledges with leadership and strategic planning. I am eager to continue down this path, as I find great satisfaction in guiding projects from conception to completion."
